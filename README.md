# FLSA-Topic-Model

Fuzzy Latent Semantic Analysis 



1- Data format

InputFile accepts both txt and csv format. Each line in a .txt or .csv is a document. The data is a txt or csv file where each line is of the form:

Document1

Document2

....

It is important to know that the last line should be empty. 




2- Seetings

First, Download and Install R and RStudio. 

Second, download FLSA_TM.R and open it with RStudio >  File > Open File.

Third, use the following commands in RStudio Console to install the prerequisite packages: 

install.packages(tm)

install.packages(svd)

install.packages(topicmodels)

install.packages(lsa)

install.packages(topsis)

install.packages(fclust)

install.packages(devtools)

install.packages(irlba)

install.packages(skmeans)

install.packages(data.table)

install.packages(SnowballC)

install.packages(wordcloud)

install.packages(RColorBrewer)

install.packages(tictoc)

Fourth, It is suggested to create a folder to save the outputs in that folder such as "/Users/Amir/Desktop/FLSA".

Fifth, The FLSA_TM function is in the following format and all the variables should be defined:

FLSA_TM (InputFile,Num_Topics,Num_Words,WW,Destination)

InputFile: A txt or csv file that each line is a document and the last line is empty. Users can put the input file in the folder that just created such as InputFile="/Users/Amir/Desktop/FLSA/data.txt"

Num_Topics: Number of Topics

Num_Words: Number of Words per topic that users want to see in Top_words_per_Topics.txt file

WW: There are four Word Weighting methods in this package.(1) WW=1 is tf_idf, (2) WW=2 is tf_normal, (3) WW=3 is tf_entropy, and (4) WW=4 is tf_gw_gfidf. Users can try all these methods to see which one works for their project. 

Destination: Users need to define the destination folder such as Destination="/Users/Amir/Desktop/FLSA"

One example is 

FLSA_TM (InputFile="/Users/Amir/Desktop/FLSA/data.txt",Num_Topics=20,Num_Words=10,WW=1,Destination="/Users/Amir/Desktop/FLSA")


FLSA_TM processing time depeneds the number of documents or the number of words.



3- Outputs

There are three files as outouts in the Destination folder:

1- Probability_of_Topics_for_Documents.txt or P(T|D)

2- Probability_of_Words_for_Topics.txt or P(W|T)

3- Top_words_per_Topics.txt to show top words per topic
